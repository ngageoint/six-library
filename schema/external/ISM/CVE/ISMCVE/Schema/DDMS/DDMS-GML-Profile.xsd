			Change Log:
			
				6/05/2007 (J. Pantella) -- Created pursuant to approved CR 2007-1.  See also http://metadata.dod.mil/irs/DDMS/cm/CR/2007/DDMS-CR-2007-1.
				6/05/2007 (J. Pantella) -- Removed all references to elements deprecated as of GML 3.2.1 pursuant to approved CR 2007-2.  See also http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/irs/DDMS/cm/CR/2007/DDMS-CR-2007-2.
				6/05/2007 (J. Pantella) -- Modified the PolygonType to remove the gml:interior element pursuant to approved CR 2007-3a.  See also http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/irs/DDMS/cm/CR/2007/DDMS-CR-2007-3a.
				6/05/2007 (J. Pantella) -- Pursuant to approved CR 2007-3b...removed the pointProperty element and it's corresponding type from the GML Profile to avoid referencing external geospatial metadata.  For discovery all metadata should be encoded in the DDMS record.  See also http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/irs/DDMS/cm/CR/2007/DDMS-CR-2007-3b.
				6/05/2007 (J. Pantella) -- Pursuant to approved CR 2007-4...the srsName attribute identifying the coordinate reference system is required on gml:Point and gml:Polygon in the DDMS GML Profile.  See also http://metadata.dod.mil/irs/DDMS/cm/2007/DDMS-CR-2007-4.
				6/05/2007 (J. Pantella) -- Added developer guidance to Point and Polygon types pursuant to CR 2007-5.   See also http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/irs/cm/CR/2007/DDMS-CR-2007-5.
				6/05/2007 (J. Pantella) -- Added gml:id attribute definition and applied it as required to gml:Point and gml:Polygon per CR 2007-6.  See also http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/irs/cm/CR/2007/DDMS-CR-2007-6.
				6/05/2007 (J. Pantella) -- Commented out the gml:posList element and its references.  There was an inadvertent omission of a CR to eliminate that element to simplify the encoding of position information.  Because the CR has not been presented to and approved by the DDMS CM Panel, the element has been commented out in this schema to discourage its use (it would otherwise have been deleted completely).  Developers that wish to use gml:posList against the current recommendation not to use it may uncomment the relevant definitions in this schema.  
				7/26/2007 (J. Pantella) -- BUG FIX --- Added gml:SRSReferenceGroupSRSNameRequired attribute group to be applied to gml:Point and gml:Polygon within the DDMS.  The gml:SRSReferenceGroup was modified to make srsName optional and applied to the gml:pos element.  This fixes a bug in the original profile which required srsName on gml:pos elements in the DDMS which is unnecessary given that the DDMS Specification explicitly states that the value of the srsName attribute on the ancestor gml:Point or gml:Polygon element of which a given gml:pos element is a descendent is controlling.  This means that if gml:pos/@srsName is specified, it must be the same as the parent gml:Point/@srsName or gml:Polygon/@srsName.  Otherwise it is considered an inconsistency and must be ignored.  Also ensured the the gml:id attribute is required on gml:Point and gml:Polygon per CR 2007-6.
				1/4/2008 (J.Pantella) -- BUG FIX --- 7/26/2007 change failed to apply the gml:SRSReferenceGroupSRSNameRequired attribute group to the gml:Point.  This modification applies the appropriate group to the gml:Point element.
				7/1/2008 (D. Barclay) -- Changed attributeFormDefault to change attribute form to unqualified (per CR 2008-7).

				<mdr:definition>A Polygon is a special surface that is defined by a single surface patch. The boundary of this patch is coplanar and the polygon uses planar interpolation in its interior. It is backwards compatible with the Polygon of GML 2, GM_Polygon of ISO 19107 is implemented by PolygonPatch.</mdr:definition>
				<mdr:comment>
Developer's Note: It is required that the srsName attribute be populated on a gml:Point or gml:Polygon element within the DDMS.  Recommended values for the attribute are:
			<!-- These Coordinate Reference System references are registered in the GSIP Governance Namespace on the DoD Metadata Registry. -->
			1) "http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/ns/GSIP/crs/WGS84C_3D" -- representing World Geodetic System 1984 - Earth Centered, Earth Fixed (ECEF), where the X axis is mass center - equator/prime meridian, and the units are meters; the Y axis is mass center - equator/90° E, and the units are meters; and the Z axis is mass center - North Pole, and the units are meters.  
			OR
			2) "http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/ns/GSIP/crs/WGS84E_2D" -- representing World Geodetic System 1984 - Geographic, 2-Dimensional, where latitude is north positive, measured in degrees; and latitude is east positive, measured in degrees.
			OR
			3) "http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/ns/GSIP/crs/WGS84E_3D" -- representing World Geodetic System 1984 - Geographic, 3-Dimensional, where latitude is north positive, measured in degrees; and latitude is east positive, measured in degrees; and height is height above ellipsoid, measured in meters.
			See also: http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/tr8350_2.html.
			
			For gml:pos elements populating the gml:Polygon/gml:exterior/gml:LinearRing/gml:pos element the following guidance should be followed:
			1.	Latitude shall be in decimal degrees in the range -90° less than or equal to latitude greater than or equal to +90°.
			2.	North latitudes shall be positive, south latitudes shall be negative.
			3.	Longitude shall be in decimal degrees in the range -180° less than or equal to longitude greater than or equal to +180°; note that there are two equally acceptable values of longitude for the meridian opposite the prime meridian.
			4.	East longitudes shall be positive, west longitudes shall be negative.
			5.	Only the element gml:pos shall be used to encode a geographic point location as either:
				a.	two decimal values in the order of latitude then longitude (no commas) when WGS84E_2D, or
				b.	three decimal values in the order latitude, longitude and finally height above ellipsoid (no commas) when using the WGS84E_3D CRS. 


Developer's Note:  The srsName attribute is required on the Polygon element.  The Polygon/@srsName is the identifier for the CRS which is controlling for the child gml:pos elements.  It is important to note that the srsName attribute may also appear on the gml:pos elements, however given the current allowable CRSs above there is no need to repeat the information on the gml:pos elements thus the srsName attribute is optional and not required.  If the srsName does appear on the gml:pos elements then it must be the same as the value of the srsName attribute on the Polygon element.

				<mdr:comment>Developer's Note:  Although gml:posList is available for use in the LinearRing it is highly recommended that this element not be used to avoid confusion and simplify the metadata representation.  The gml:posList was supposed to be removed in version 1.4 but was inadvertently left out of the set of GML Change Requests.  The posList element has been commented out in this version but if you choose to use it against this recommendation, you may uncomment it and its definition below.  Note however that this element may be eliminated pursuant to a future change request.
