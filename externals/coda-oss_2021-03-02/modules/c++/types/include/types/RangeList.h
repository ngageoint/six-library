 * \class RangeList
 * \brief Maintain an ordered collection of disjoint types::Range objects
 *
 * RangeList is meant to hold, and provide operations on, a set of ordered,
 * disjoint types::Range objects. Range objects are ordered by increasing
 * mStartElement.
 *
 *         +-------------+   +----------+       +-------------+
 *         | range 0     |   | range 1  |       | range 2     |
 *         +-------------+   +----------+       +-------------+
 *   |-------------------------------------------------------------->
 *   0                                                         max(size_t)
 *
 * Many of the operations are O(N), where N is the number of ranges in the
 * collection. As a result, caution should be taken when using this class
 * that N does not grow large enough to begin having a noticeable impact.
 *
 * TODO: Take a look at replacing the internals with some interval list
 *       structure.
