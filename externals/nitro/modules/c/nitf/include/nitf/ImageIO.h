 \brief  NITF Image segment image data I/O object (nitf_ImageIO)

 \todo Implement deep copy clone
 The nitf_ImageIO object is used to manage the pixel data I/O for one image
 segment of a NITF image.

 The pixel type constants are needed for an argument of the down-sample
 plug-in functions. Their odd encoding is because they are used internally
 as part of a mask that contains other private bit definitions.

  \brief nitf_ImageIO_read - Read a sub-window

  \b nitf_ImageIO_read reads a sub-window. The user supplies the opened file
  descriptor and data buffers. The file should allow seeks. The file is left in
  the file position of the last read.

  If the \em padded argument returns TRUE the request may include pad pixels.
  For blocked images, each block may contain pad pixels. It is possible to
  determine that a given block contains pads but it is not always possible
  to tell which ones. So a request may hit a block with pad pixels but miss
  the actual pixels. Thus the padded flag is only a maybe. A FALSE value
  does mean that there are not pad pixels in the request.

  The user must supply one buffer for each band requested in the sub-window.
  Each buffer must have enough storage for one band of the requested
  sub-window size.

  Row and column skips of more than one in the sub-window are not currently
  implemented.

  \param nitf The associated nitf_ImageIO object
  \param io The IO interface
  \param subWindow Sub-window to read
  \param padded Returns TRUE if pad pixels may have been read
  \param error [out] Error object
  \return Returns FALSE on error

  On error, FALSE is returned and the user supplied error object is set.

  Possible errors include:

    Write in progress
    Invalid sub-set or band
    System I/O or memory allocation errors
