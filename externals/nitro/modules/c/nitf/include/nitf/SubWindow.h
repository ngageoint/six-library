 * \struct nitf_SubWindow
 * \brief Sub-window specification structure
 *
 * The \b nitf_SubWindow specifies a sub-window. This object is used as an
 * argument to image read and write requests to specify the data requested.
 *
 * The \em bandList field specifies the desired bands. Bands are numbered
 * starting with zero and ordered as the bands appear physically in the file.
 * The user must supply one buffer for each requested band. Each buffer must
 * have enough storage for one band of the requested subimage size.
 *
 * The downsampler determines what downsampling (if any) is performed on
 * this sub-window request.  There is no default downsampler.  If you just
 * want to perform pixel skipping, call setDownSampler() with a
 * PixelSkip object.
