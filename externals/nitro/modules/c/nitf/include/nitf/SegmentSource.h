 *  \fn nitf_SegmentMemorySource_construct
 *  \brief A class for reading segment data from memory (or VM)
 *
 *  The memory source class allows us to read directly from
 *  a data buffer.  In the event that this is a memory-mapped file,
 *  we will likely get a performance gain over the direct fd approach.
 *
 *  The constructor takes in a buffer, a size, and optionally
 *  a sampling factor (Typically, the factor will be applied most
 *  times during the case of memory mapping, although it may
 *  be used to sample down or cut the image into pieces).
 *
 *  Contains a static declaration of the specific implementation.
 *
 *  \param data The data
 *  \param size The size
 *  \param start The start offset
 *  \param byteSkip The number of bytes to skip (0 signifies contiguous read)
 *  \param copyData Whether or not to make a copy of the data.  If this is
 *  false, the data must outlive the memory source.

 *  Construct a file source from a handle, a start point, and
