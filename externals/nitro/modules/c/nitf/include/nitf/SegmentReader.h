  \brief nitf_SegmentReader - Reader object for reading Segments

  The nitf_SegmentReader object provides support for reading segment data. A simple
  byte stream oriented model is provided that presents the data as a self-
  contained, flat file of bytes. Seeking within the virtual file is permitted.

  The segment reader uses the IOHandle supplied (and retained) by the Reader
  during the nitf_Reader_read call which must precede the use of the
  segment reader. The user must not use this IOHandle during the read of the
  data. The file position of this handle is maintained by the segment reader
  and it may not move in a way that is consistent with the movement of
  the pointer in the virtual file.

  The constructor for this object is a method of the nitf_Reader object. The
  methods available are:
                nitf_Reader_newTextReader
                nitf_Reader_newGraphicReader


  \param input The input interface
  \param dataLength The length of the user data
  \param baseOffset Offset to the start of data
  \param virtualOffset current offset (within this region)

/*!
  \brief nitf_SegmentReader_read - Read segment data

  The nitf_SegmentReader_read function reads data from the associated segment.
  The reading of the data is serial as if a flat file were being read by an
  input stream. Except for the first argument, this function has the same
  calling sequence and behavior as IOHandle_read.

  \return TRUE is returned on success. On error, the error object
  is set.

  The nitf_SegmentReader_seek function allows the user to seek within the extension

  of the segment data.
