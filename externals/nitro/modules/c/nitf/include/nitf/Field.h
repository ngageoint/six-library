 *                   * Hurt them and then return 16 bit value
 *      - If the user is requesting a 32 bit integer
 *                   * Give them back a 32 bit integer, converted using NITF_ATO32()

 *  = If the data is a binary integer
 *      - If the user is requesting an integer
 *                   * Hurt them (just kidding).  Make sure the internal and external sizes are same
 *                     then give them it back in the right format
 *      - If the user is requesting a string
 *                   * Allocate a 256 byte buffer, snprintf to the buffer, and give them what they are
