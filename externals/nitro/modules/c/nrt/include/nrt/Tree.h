 *
 *  This object provides the base node for a tree
 *  data structure (not to be confused with a TRE,
 *  or Tagged Record Extension).  Trees may be useful
 *  for certain kinds of parsing, and it may also at
 *  some point become the default storage for TREs
 *  themselves.  Since a tree isnt really a flat data
 *  structure, traversal functions may be more appropriate
 *  than our typical
