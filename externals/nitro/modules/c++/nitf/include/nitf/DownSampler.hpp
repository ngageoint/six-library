     *  \param numWindowRows  How many rows for the input window
     *  \param numWindowCols  How many cols for the input window
     *  \param numInputCols  Number of columns in input buffer, full res
     *  \param numSubWindowCols  The number of columns in the sub-window
     *  \param pixelType  The pixel type (valid values found in System layer)
     *  \param pixelSize  The size of one pixel
     *  \param rowsInLastWindow  The number of rows in the final window
     *  \param colsInLastWindow  The number of cols in the final window
     *
     *  Note:
     *  The numWindowRows, numWindowCols, and numSubWindowCols values
     *  are in output image units (units of sample windows).  For example,
     *  with a pixel skip of 3 in columns, if the sub-window request spans
     *  columns 0-299, then numSubWindowCols is 100.  If the block is
     *  such that a particular request spans columns 90-149 (60 full
     *  resolution columns), then numWindowCols is 20.  The numInputCols
     *  value is in full resolution units.  This value gives the length,
     *  in pixels, of one row in the input buffer.  This buffer is used
     *  for all down sample calls.  Since the number of windows can vary
     *  from call to call, this buffer has a worst case length.  Therefore,
     *  it is not possible to move from one row to the next with just the
     *  number of sample windows per row (numWindowCols) for the current
     *  request.
