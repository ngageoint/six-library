 *  a data buffer.  In the event that this is a memory-mapped file,
 *  we will likely get a performance gain over the direct fd approach.
 *
 *  The constructor takes in a buffer, a size, and optionally a
 *  sampling factor (Typically, the factor will be applied most
 *  times during the case of memory mapping, although it may be used
 *  to sample down or cut the data into pieces).
