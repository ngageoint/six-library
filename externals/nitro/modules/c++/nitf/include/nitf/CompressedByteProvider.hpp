 * \class CompressedByteProvider
 * \brief Used to provide corresponding raw NITF bytes (including NITF headers)
 * when provided with some AOI of the compressed pixel data. See docstring
 * of parent class for details.
 * Limitations:
 * - Graphics, labels, texts, and reserved extensions are not supported
 * - Image segments and data extension segments are supported.
 * - TREs are supported in the file header and/or image subheaders in either
 * the user-defined or extended sections
 * - Multiple image segments are supported, but only where the images are
 * intended to be vertically stacked (so the number of columns must match and
 * all indexing will be as if the image segments are intended to be vertically
 * stacked in order.  ILOC and IALVL are not checked).
 *
 * The NITF layout is described in ByteProvider.hpp

     * The caller provides an AOI of the pixel data.  This method provides back
     * a list of contiguous buffers corresponding to the raw NITF bytes for
     * this portion of the file.  If this AOI is in the middle of an image
     * segment, this will be simply a buffer list of length 1 consisting of the
     * input pointer (no copy occurs).  Otherwise, pointers to various headers
     * (file header, image subheader(s), DES subheader and data) will
     * be in the buffer list before, in the middle, and/or after the image
     * data.  If this method is called multiple times with AOIs that
     * eventually consist of the entire image, and the raw bytes are written
     * out to disk in order with respect to the start pixel rows this method is
     * called with (or out of order but seeking to the provided file offset
     * each time), and in the order contained in the buffer list, it will form
     * a valid NITF.
     *
     * \note This method does not perform byte swapping on the pixel data for
     * efficiency reasons, but NITFs are written out in big endian order.  This
     * means that on a little endian system, you must byte swap the pixel data
     * prior to calling this method.
     *
     * \note This method does not perform any blocking on the pixel data.  If
     * the NITF is blocked, the pixel data must already be in a contiguous
     * blocked memory layout, including pad pixels for partial blocks.
     *
     * \param imageData The image data pixels to write.  The underlying type
     * after compression will be a single byte per pixel.
     * \param startRow The global start row in pixels as to where these pixels
     * are in the image.  If this is a multi-segment NITF, this is still simply
     * the global pixel location.
     * \param numRows The number of rows in the provided 'imageData'
     * \param[out] fileOffset The offset in bytes in the NITF where these
     * buffers should be written
     * \param[out] buffers One or more pointers to raw bytes of data.  These
     * should be written out in the order they are provided in the buffer list.
     * The pointers point to the provided pixel data and, if required, one or
     * more NITF headers.  No copies occur, so these buffers are only valid for
     * the lifetime of this provider object (since this object owns the raw
     * bytes for the NITF headers) and the lifetime of the passed-in image
     * data.
