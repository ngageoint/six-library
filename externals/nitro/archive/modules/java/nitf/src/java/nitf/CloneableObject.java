/**
 * This class is a NITFObject that can be cloned. <p/>
 * -------------------------- Note to Developer -------------------------- Since
 * this extends DestructibleObject, when it gets created, it is referenced
 * within the NITFUtil class. When we clone things, we want a separate reference
 * to that new memory. Since DestructibleObject takes care of that for us, we
 * don't need anything separate in here that tracks the clone memory. <p/> For
 * some objects that we may want to make cloneable from within Java, we may not
 * want to destruct the memory of the original, since it might be part of a
 * larger structure (for example, FileHeader is part of a Record, and should not
 * be destructed or else it will disrupct the parent Record). However, we will
 * want to be able to destruct the clone object. For this reason, these
 * particular objects will have to check to see if itself is a clone first
 * before calling the super.destruct(). Thus, for some objects, it is a good
 * idea to override the DestructibleObject.destruct() method. Keep that in mind.
