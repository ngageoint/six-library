 * Sum of square, two band, down-sample method
 * 
 * The maximum is calculated as the sum of the sum of squares of two bands. The
 * caller must supply exactly two bands. The complex pixel type as the
 * individual band pixel type is not supported
 * 
 * For a more comprehensive discussion of the merits and drawbacks of this type
 * of down-sampling, please refer to the NITF manual 1.1.
