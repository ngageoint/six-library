 *  \file io.h
 *  \brief Includes all headers necessary for IO.
 *
 *  This package is based on the Java io package.
 *  For the upcoming 0.1.1 release of the modules,
 *  we will support the io.File API as well.
 *
 *  The io package takes a more simple but still powerful
 *  approach to streaming.  We have a built in buffering mechanism
 *  that can be activated simply by using the InputStream interface's
 *  streamTo() method, connecting it to an OutputStream.
 *
 *  Many of the streams are also implemented as filters, allowing them
 *  to pipe or stream, or sort data that is incoming, and affect its
 *  appearance as it is outgoing.
 *
 *  Furthermore, BidirectionalStream implementors share the duties of
 *  InputStream and OutputStream, allowing for a 2-way abstraction that
 *  Java is lacking, while supporting a whole slew of InputStream sources
 *  that C++ does not support at all (URLs, sockets, serializers, etc).
 *
 *  Finally, we support the beginnings of serialization at this level,
 *  although we do little to enforce standards for it (we recommend XML/SOAP
 *  for most applications.  Check out the SOAPMessage class in xml.soap.
