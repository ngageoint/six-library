 *  \brief This class is interface like and completes the Seekable interface.
 *
 *  When I first created the Seekable interface, I overlooked the possible
 *  use-case that you may, in fact, wish to guarantee that your Seekable
 *  is also an InputStream.  What you would have, then, are two derived types:
 *  SeekableInputStream, SeekableOutputStream, and SeekableBidirectionalStream.
 *  Here are the definitions, which will allow that inheritance
