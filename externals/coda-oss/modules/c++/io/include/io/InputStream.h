 * class.  It is responsible for reading, and it is
 * streamable.  When the streaming feature is used, an internal
 * buffer is used, and the destination is an OutputStream.
 * This "piping" feature is not found in the java class,
 * but it is important because it allows for quick, efficient transfers
 * of large streams of bytes.
