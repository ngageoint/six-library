<h1 align=center>Getting Started With XML and xml.lite</h1>
<hr></hr>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This article teaches you how to use the XML utilities provided in
<b>xml.lite</b> and offers insight into choosing the right implementations 
for you.  It assumes that you have little experience using XML, but you
are familiar with the basics of it (on paper), and it guides you from there.
</p>

<h2>Seeing XML for the First Time</h2>

<p>
Realistically, you may never have seen XML, or you may not be very familiar
with XML documents.  This article focuses on the toolkit API for using
XML, not on the structure of XML.  If you need a quick briefing on what XML
is and how its used, consult any or all of the links below:

<h3>DOM vs. SAX</h3>

<p>Frequent XML users will be familiar with the difference between DOM and
SAX parser, and may wish to move on.  <b>xml.lite</b> provides nearly the 
entire SAX2 (namespace enabled) specification, and the <i>important</i> 
basic DOM structures.  As we explore the differences, you will
come to have an understanding of which type of parsing is right for you.</p>

<p>
As implied by the name, <b>xml.lite</b> subscribes to the notion that
programming XML should be as trivial as possible.  The implementation follows
that of PyXML with its "sax driver" approach, as well as the perl and php
implementations.  In other words, we build a simple DOM tree using an
underlying SAX parser (we call it a driver).  SAX is an Acronym for Simple
API for XML.  What it really means, though, is "event-driven" parser.  SAX
is based on the notion of callbacks, and every time that it picks up some
data from an XML document, it calls up some functions.  Briefly, these
functions are associated with:
  <ol>
    <li>Beginning tags and attributes</li>
    <li>Ending tag</li>
    <li>Character data</li>
    <li>Namespace mappings</li>
    <li>DTD handlers</li>
    <li>Comments</li>
  </ol>

Note that in the current implementations, DTDs are not supported by 
xml.lite's sax driver.  This will be updated soon, however, we strongly
favor XMLSchemas instead of DTDs which are nearing deprecation.
SAX is much faster and leaner that DOM for loading, but content must
be handled by the user.  In other words, a developer must inherit the
SAX ContentHandler class and describe what to do with the inputs.  This
works well on simple XML structures but it is tedious for complex ones.
For almost all uses, I recommend the DOM model instead.
</p>

<p>DOM is an acronynm for Document Object Model.  What this means is that
it builds an image of the document as a tree in memory.  This can lead to
a much larger memory footprint, which may make it undesirable for larger
programs with strict memory constraints (the author has found that, in
practice, this is rarely the case).</p>

<h2>Your first XML processing</h2>

The code snippet below simply reads an XML document into a tree, and prints 
the tree to the command line:



<pre>
   io::StandardOutStream out;
   xml::lite::MinidomParser p;
   p.parse( io::FileInputStream( "myfile.xml" );
   xml::lite::Element* root = p->getDocument()->getRootElement();   
   root->print(out);
</pre>


We could even use a URL, which often contain XML.  For instance, if you
have an xhtml document, point your parse() method at it instead:

<pre>
   p.parse( net::http::URLInputStream( "http://sei1.erim-int.com/blah/index.xhtml" );
</pre>

<h2>Manipulating Elements</h2>
Now say that we want to print our element information, but only if
the tag is named &lt;print&gt;.

e.g.,

<pre>
&lt;ex&gt;
  &lt;print&gt;Hello World.&lt;/print&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;
  &lt;c&gt;printf("Hello World.\n");&lt;/c&gt;
  &lt;perl&gt;print "Hello World.\n";&lt;/perl&gt;
  &lt;php&gt;echo "Hello World.\n";&lt;/php&gt;
  &lt;java&gt;System.out.println("Hello World.");&lt;/java&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;print&gt;Goodbye Cruel World.&lt;/print&gt;
&lt;/ex&gt;
</pre>

We can easily print only that information, very simply:

<pre>
xml::lite::MinidomParser p;
p.parse( file );
xml::lite::Element* root = p->getDocument()->getRootElement();
std::vector&lt;Element*&gt; elements;
// This will return two elements
root->getElementsByTagName( "print", elements);
for (int i = 0; i < elements.size(); i++)
{
   cout << elements[i].getCharacterData() << endl;
}

</pre>

This will print:

<pre>
Hello World.
Goodbye Cruel World.
</pre>

Now let's say that we want to get the code section, determine if
there is a language that the user requested, and print the 
program code for Hello World from it.

<ol>
   <li>User starts our program with the input language</li>
   <li>We search for that language in the above file</li>
   <ul>
   <li>If it does not exist, we report that we couldnt find it</li>
   <li>If it does, we retrieve it and print the code for it to standard out</li>
   </ul>
</ol>


<pre>


#include &lt;import/except.h&gt;
#include &lt;import/sys.h&gt;
#include &lt;import/io.h&gt;
#include &lt;import/xml/lite.h&gt;
using namespace except;
using namespace sys;
using namespace io;
using namespace xml::lite;

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  try
  {
     if (argc != 2)
     {
         die_printf("Usage: hello_world <language>\n");
     }
     MinidomParser p;
     p.parse("langdb.xml");

     Element* root = p.getDocument()->getRootElement();
     if (! root->hasElement("code")
        __raise__(NoSuchKeyException( "code" );
     
     std::vector&lt;Element*&gt; e;
     
     root->getElementsByTagName( "code", e);
     
     // We will only read the first element named code under 'ex'
     if (! e[0]->hasElement( argv[1] ); // The language doesnt exist
         cout &lt;&lt; "No such language in the database.  Sorry..." &lt;&lt; endl;

     else 
     {
         Element* theLanguage = e[0]->getElementsByTagName( argv[1] );
	 cout <<	 theLanguage->getCharacterData() << endl;

     } 

  }
  catch (Error& e)
  {
     cerr &lt;&lt; "Caught error: " &lt;&lt; e.getMessage() &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  catch (Exception& x)
  {
     cerr &lt;&lt; "Caught exception: " &lt;&lt; x.getMessage() &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  catch (...)
  {
     cerr &lt;&lt; "Caught unnamed exception" &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<h2>Trimming hedges</h2>


Say I have grow disillusioned with my disillusionment, and I wish to 
remove my "Cruel World" statement.

I could change it like so:

<pre>
   root->getElementsByTagName("print", e);
   // Remember that e[1] contains the second print, and e[0] is hello world
   e[1]->setCharacterData("Goodbye World");
</pre>

That will change the value within the tree.  Simple enough; but what if I
think its not only obnoxious, but its distracting the above program's functionality.  After all, I dont have any code example, and it wouldnt be any
different from the 'hello world' code anyway.  



<h3>Tangent: Who owns what</h3>
If you are using a MinidomParser, you must understand that <i>IT</i>
owns the tree elements, not you.  This differs from auto_ptr based systems,
etc.  This prevents multiple copies from being explicitly created.  When
you use an accessor and retrieve node, you must not delete it using delete.
Use the tree's remove() method to drop nodes.

<p>Ok, Let's just get rid of it:


<pre>
   // Lets remove it and all sub-components from the tree.
   Document* doc =   p.getDocument();
   Element* root =   doc->getRootElement();
   ...
   doc->remove(e[1]);
   
   // Can't use e[1] anymore, it is null
   
   // I can now prove its gone from the tree
   root->print();

</pre>

<h2>What is an XMLSchema?</h2>

<p>A schema is a way of organizing and validating data in XML.
It is very complicated and very irritating, but the service
that it provides is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The general idea with XMLSchema is that you use an XML document to
'validate' another XML document.  You then use a special meta-document
for that meta-document, developed by the W3C committee to create your
meta-document, or schema.  Sounds confusing?  It is, but the good news
is that most of you wont need to worry about schemas for now.  Just know
that they are out there.  However, if you want to know more, check out the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema.html">XML Schema documentation</a>
for more information</p>



<h2>Tags, Namespaces and QNames</h2>

<p>When SAX came out, there were no namespaces in XML.  This made everything
really simple.  Everyone knew that you couldnt name two tags the same thing,
and, though cumbersome, folks accepted that.  XML soon become a standard
for processing data, which meant that large chunks of data had to be transferred
around.  Obviously, when referencing (including) other documents all over 
an already large XML document, the chances of naming conflicts grow substantially.  The XML gods became worried, and made a recommendation for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">namespaces in XML document</a>.  In the beginning,
nobody supported namespaces, and, well, nobody used them either.

<p>When XMLSchema (see xs documentation), 
and later SOAP (see xml.soap documentation) came out, developers started
scrambling to support namespaces, and interfaces once noted for their simplicity (ok, DOM never was simple, but remember that for SAX, simple is in the name),
became much uglier.  Briefly, the way that namespaces are handled in XML is
as follows:
   <ol>
     <li>Tags come in two parts, the local name and the prefix.
     This is called a <i>QName</i></li>
     <li>Each QName has an associated uri that is a real document
     describing the types declared in that QName</li>
     <li>QNames go out of scope when the tag bearing the uri declaration
     is popped off of the stack.</li>  
   </ol>
</p>

<p>Simply put, here is the anatomy of a tag:

<pre>
&lt;<i>prefix</i>:<b>localName</b>&gt;
</pre>
where prefix was mapped to a real live uri in such a manner:

<pre>
&lt;sometag xmlns:prefix="uri"&gt;
</pre>

and uri is a site containg a declaration of the type of localName,
using XMLSchema.  The good news is, once again, you probably wont need
this for basic XML processing for quite some time (unless you are
using XML/SOAP).

<h2>What About Attributes?</h2>

<p>Attributes are key-value pairs that are allowed to follow a tag.
They appear immediately following the tag, and they are stored as
essentially a list.  Attributes also may have namespaces from or until
the tag which declares that namespace goes out of scope.  This is
frustrating for many programmers, who will likely choose to forget namespaces
altogether, but for substantial applications, this support is necessary.
For better or for worse, I chose to implement
the SAX2 API here, instead of a more C++-tuned approach (with maybe an Attributes object implemented as an STL vector instead. The internal storage, for the record, is currently a std::vector&lt; xml::lite::AttributeNode &gt;.
This is a more consistant approach with other languages and the SAX spec, and 
therefore I chose it over some slicker counterpart.
</p>


<pre>
   // xml::lite::Element* e = some node;
   xml::lite::Attributes attrs;
   e->getAttributes( attrs );
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; attrs.getLength(); i++)
   {
       cout &lt;&lt; "Key: " &lt;&lt; attrs.getLocalName( i ) &lt;&lt; endl;;
       cout &lt;&lt; "Value: " &lt;&lt; attrs.getValue( i ) &lt;&lt; endl;;
   } 

</pre>


<h2>Using SAX: Simple Example</h2>
Let's say that all I want to do is print this document in color coding.
Maybe I have a syntax highlighting screen API like curses, or maybe the
result goes to a editor:

<pre>

class SmartPrint : public xml::lite::ContentHandler
{
public:
  SmartPrint(MyXMLDisplay* display) : mDisplay(display) {}
  ~SmartPrint() {}
  
  void startElement( const std::string& uri, 
                     const std::string& localName,
                     const std::string& qname,
                     const xml::lite::Attributes& attr )
  {
      mDisplay->beginTagInColor( qname, attr );
      crossRef( uri );      
  }
  void endElement( const std::string& uri, 
                   const std::string& localName,
                   const std::string& qname )
  {
      mDisplay->endTagInColor( qname );
      
  }

  void characters( const char* data, int length)
  {
      mDisplay->charDataInColor( data, length );
  } 
private:
  MyXMLDisplay* mDisplay;
  ...
};

</pre>

To bind this code to our SAX reader, we can set the content handler:

<pre>

// Probably X for Unix and Win32 for Windows, but could be console
MyXMLDisplay* display = MyXMLDisplayFactory::createDisplay();

XMLReader reader;

reader.setContentHandler( new SmartPrint( display ) );

// This shows the code in the display area
reader.parse( document );

</pre>

<h2>SAX is Complicated but Powerful</h2>

<p>Because xml.lite's SAX2 interface is very similar to the
original, you may refer to the <a href="http://www.saxproject.org/">SAX2 specification</a>for more
details on how to implement SAX code.  The code should be similar
or identical across systems, libraries, and even languages.  Actually, the
same is true for DOM, both were designed for a common API.  SAX is actually
a Java specification, but it was so popular that it has a binding in
many languages now.
