 *  \brief The handler for SAX 2.0
 *  \todo  Implement start/endPrefixMapping
 * 
 *  A SAX reader requires a processing unit known as the 
 *  "content handler."  Contained herein is the implementation for
 *  a simple one.  Unlike the SAX specification, we dont separate the
 *  ContentHandler (which is an interface in SAX) from the
 *  DefaultContentHandler.  This lowers package complexity, 
 *  and leaves us with a practical base from which to inherit.  
 *  Any functionality that we dont add is not pure virtual, but is 
 *  an empty function call.
 *
 *  This saves the trouble of having to redefine every interface 
 *  method, allowing the developer to focus only on the routines
 *  which he or she is interested in defining.
 *  It also leaves us with less virtual classes hanging around, 
 *  which should increase performance and efficiency.
