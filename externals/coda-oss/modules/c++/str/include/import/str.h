 *  \brief The str module includes all objects for string manipulation
 *
 *  When performing string operations, it is sometimes the case that the
 *  Standard Library std::string class is simply not enough.  The str
 *  module is a conglomeration of useful string manipulations including
 *  a Tokenizer class and a c-style formatting functions.
 *
 *  This library is intended to compliment the STL while providing additional
 *  functionality that the standard lacks
