 *  \brief Simple utility to allow allocation and splitting of work buffers
 *
 *  This class just represents views of the same buffer.  This buffer can
 *  be split into sub-views as desired, which have the same interface.
 *
 *  This is really just to simplify interfaces and make it easy to manipulate
 *  a small set of memory pools
