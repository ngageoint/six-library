/*!
 *  \class ScopedCopyablePtr
 *  \brief This class provides RAII for object allocations via new.  It is a
 *         light wrapper around std::auto_ptr and has the same semantics
 *         except that the copy constructor and assignment operator are deep
 *         copies (that is, they use T's copy constructor) rather than
 *         transferring ownership.
 *
 *         This is useful for cases where you have a class which has a member
 *         variable that's dynamically allocated and you want to provide a
 *         valid copy constructor / assignment operator.  With raw pointers or
 *         std::auto_ptr's, you'll have to write the copy constructor /
 *         assignment operator for this class - this is tedious and
 *         error-prone since you need to include all the members in the class.
 *         Using ScopedCopyablePtr's instead, the compiler-generated copy
 *         constructor and assignment operator for your class will be correct
 *         (if all the other member variables are POD or have correct
 *         copy constructors / assignment operators).
