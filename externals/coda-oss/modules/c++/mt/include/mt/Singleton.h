/*!
 * \brief Templated, thread-safe Singleton
 * 
 * The Singleton class guarantees that at any given time in an application's
 * life cycle, only 1 instance of the templated object will be in existence.
 * Singleton is a great way to implement the Manager design pattern.
 * 
 * The Singleton takes in the Object class type as the first template parameter.
 * So, for example, if you had a Logger class and you wanted only one instance
 * of it throughout your program, you could do this:
 * 
 * typedef mt::Singleton<Logger> LoggerManager;
 * ...
 * LoggerManager::getInstance().log("singleton log message");
 * 
 * The second template parameter is a bool which denotes whether the Singleton
 * should automatically destroy the owned object at program exit. By default,
 * this flag is set to false, thus NOT destroying the internal object at exit.
 * The public destroy() method of the Singleton can be used to manually destroy
 * the singleton object. This lets the user facilitate how/when the Singleton
 * gets destroyed.
 * 
 * Most users will want to set AutoDestroy to true, since they want the memory
 * to be freed up automatically at exit. Be careful when keeping AutoDestroy
 * set to false, for this means that you, the user, are in charge of calling
 * destroy() when you are finished using the Singleton. Going back to the
 * previous example of a singleton Logger, here is how you would create one
 * that gets destroyed at program exit:
 * 
 * typedef mt::Singleton<Logger, true> LoggerManager; 
 * 
 * Notice that this implementation of the Singleton pattern uses the
 * atexit method for deleting the singleton instance, rather than an
 * auto_ptr. This is done b/c there is a valid use case the auto_ptr
 * gets destroyed (as well as the underlying memory), but if the Singleton
 * gets revived, the auto_ptr does NOT get recreated, and returns an invalid
 * memory address.
 *
