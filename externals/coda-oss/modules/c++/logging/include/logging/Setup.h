 *  This is a simple utility for logging. Creation of the logger is
 *  non-trivial in nature, so this helpful utility reduces the setup
 *  to a few parameters.
 *
 *  \param program  - name of the program doing the logging
 *  \param logLevel - level of logging (debug|warning|info|error|critical)
 *  \param logFile  - location where to log (default: console logs to std::cout)
 *  \param logFormat- format of the log (default: [%p] (%d) %m)
 *  \param logCount - number of rotating logs to keep (default: 0 no rotation)
 *  \param logBytes - number of bytes per rotating log (default: 0 no rotation)
