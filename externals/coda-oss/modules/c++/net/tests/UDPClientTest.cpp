 *  \brief 2 transaction UDP client
 *
 *  Create a UDP socket, "connect()-ed" to the socket address.
 *  Though UDP is connectionless, making this call tells the API
 *  that the code is only interested in one peer, and that all transactions
 *  should be done back and forth with that peer.
 *
 *  The packet we transfer
 *  is essentially meaningless at this time -- just a very basic
 *  kind of packet that approximates what you might send in real lief.
 *
 *  As we are a client to another machine, we need the IP address and port of
 *  a serving machine as arguments.
 *
 *  File simply sends a packet to the server, and recv()'s back a return value
 *  back from it.  For UDP, we would normally use recvFrom() and sendTo(),
 *  except that the ClientSocketFactory connects us to the server as mentioned
 *  above.
