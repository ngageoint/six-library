 *  \brief 2 transaction TCP server
 *
 *  Create a TCP socket, bound to the socket address, listening on a port
 *
 *  The packet we transfer
 *  is essentially meaningless at this time -- just a very basic
 *  kind of packet that approximates what you might send in real life.
 *
 *  As we are a server to another machine, we need the port that we will
 *  be bound to and that our listening socket will live on.  We accept one (1)
 *  incoming connection from a client.
 *
 *  File simply recv's a packet from the client, and sends back a return value
 *  (1).
