 *  \brief 2 transaction UDP server
 *
 *  Create a UDP socket, bound to the socket address.
 *
 *  The packet we transfer
 *  is essentially meaningless at this time -- just a very basic
 *  kind of packet that approximates what you might send in real life.
 *
 *  As we are a server to another machine, we need the port that we will
 *  be bound to.
 *
 *  File simply recv's a packet from the client, and sends back a return value
 *  (1).
