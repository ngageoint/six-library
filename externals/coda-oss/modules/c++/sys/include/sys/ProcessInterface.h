 *  \brief Runtime, system-independent process creation API
 *
 *  When it comes to multitasking, we almost all prefer threads to
 *  heritage process calls.  However, threads and processes are almost
 *  never equivalent.  Sometimes we need a process.  Here we define
 *  a simple API for process creation in a system-independent manner
