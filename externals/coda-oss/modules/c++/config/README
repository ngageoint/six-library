This module represents the "configure" step for the entire C++ set of libraries.
It exists independently to ensure it can always build first with no
circular dependencies. Its sole responsibility is to generate "coda_oss_config.h"

Key defines in "coda_oss_config.h":
  - CODA_EXPORT:  Expands to __declspec(dllexport) when building
                  shared libraries on Windows

  - __CODA_CPP11: Defined if the library is compiled with C++11 support
