 *  \class MemoryWriteHandler
 *  \brief Overloaded NITF write handler from memory buffer
 *
 *  This is used to write an image buffer from memory.  Each row is read
 *  one at a time and transferred into the write handle.  It makes use
 *  of NITRO's low-level WriteHandler API, which assumes that you will handle
 *  the heavy lifting.  This is not typically used, since the ImageWriter
 *  is more general, but in the case of pixel interleaved data, the 
 *  WriteHandler is the most efficient method of data transfer into a NITF.
 *
 *  This class can handle both SIDD and SICD data.  In the current state
 *  of SIDD, data is always 1 or 3 channels and the size of the channel
 *  is always 1, so there is no byte swapping (this may not necessarily always
 *  remain this way).
 *
 *  For SICD data, we do have 2 channels, one for I and one for Q.  
 *  Additionally the channel size is 4 or 2.
 *
 *  The SICD/SIDD NITF writer sets this object up, one per actual image 
 *  segment. The caller is responsible for dealing with segmentation
 *  beforehand
