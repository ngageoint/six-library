 *  \class ReadControl
 *  \brief Interface for reading a SICD/SIDD from a container format
 *
 *  Abstract Base Class for readers to implement.  The ReadControl
 *  is responsible for loading and reading SICD/SIDD files.
 *
 *  The class is initialized with the load() method, at which point,
 *  meta-data is read in.
 *
 *  The interleaved() function loads a Region into memory, abstracting
 *  any file format details.  For example, if the file is a segmented
 *  NITF (i.e., the array size was larger than 10GB), the user can
 *  still request pixels from anywhere in that array, without having
 *  to know that the NITF is split due to technical complications.
 *
