 *  \class Classification
 *  \brief Security record block
 *
 *  This structure is used by both the DerivedData and ComplexData objects
 *  to store security information.  Only the SIDD requires this block
 *  to be populated in the XML data, however, we also use it to write
 *  container specific information using the free parameters.
 *  
 *  SICD writers should be able to create a reasonable classification block
 *  in the NITF by simply populating the base parameters in this structure,
 *  however, occasionally, the developer may need to match a spec. that
 *  diverges from the stock SIDD population requirements.  In that case,
 *  users can also get the free parameters to set NITF fields
 *  directly.  The free parameters are applied last, by the file format
 *  container.  Currently only NITF free parameters are supported.
