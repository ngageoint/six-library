 * \class CompressedByteProvider
 * \brief Used to provide corresponding compressed NITF bytes
 * (and uncompressed NITF headers) when provided with some AOI of the pixel data.
 * The idea is that if getBytes() is called multiple times, eventually for the
 * entire image, the raw bytes provided back will be the entire NITF file.
 * This abstraction is useful if separate threads, processes, or even machines
 * have only portions of the SICD/SIDD pixel data and are all trying to write
 * out a single file; in that scenario, this class provides all the raw bytes
 * corresponding to the caller's AOI, including NITF headers if necessary.
 * The caller does not need to understand anything about the NITF file layout
 * in order to write out the file.
 * The bytes are intentionally provided back as a series of pointers
 * rather than one contiguous block of memory in order to minimize the number of
 * copies.
