 *  \class Region
 *  \brief Request window into pixel data
 *
 *  Gives the user a region into the pixel data.  This class is
 *  used for both complex and derived products.  When you initialize
 *  this object, you can set your own malloc'ed work buffer.  When you
 *  request a read from ReadControl, we check your mBuffer value to
 *  see if you set it to a non-nullptr address.  If so, we assume that you
 *  have created a properly sized buffer, and we will use that buffer
 *  for the request.  If you leave it nullptr (the path of least resistance),
 *  we assume that you intend for us to allocate a properly sized rectangle
 *  before the buffer is filled with pixel data.
 *
 *  Returned data is always component-interleaved.
