 *
 *  This class implements the Builder design pattern by building
 *  and maintaining a DerivedData instance.  This class is the preferred
 *  method for creating a DerivedData object.  It should be used for one-offs
 *  or using get() in conjunction with the clone() method in the
 *  DerivedData object as a prototype.
