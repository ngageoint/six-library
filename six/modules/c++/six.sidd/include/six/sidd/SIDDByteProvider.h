/*!
 * \class SIDDByteProvider
 * \brief Used to provide corresponding raw NITF bytes (including NITF headers)
 * when provided with some AOI of the pixel data.  The idea is that if
 * getBytes() is called multiple times, eventually for the entire image, the
 * raw bytes provided back will be the entire NITF file.  This abstraction is
 * useful if separate threads, processes, or even machines have only portions of
 * the SIDD pixel data and are all trying to write out a single file; in that
 * scenario, this class provides all the raw bytes corresponding to the caller's
 * AOI, including NITF headers if necessary.  The caller does not need to
 * understand anything about the NITF file layout in order to write out the
 * file.  The bytes are intentionally provided back as a series of pointers
 * rather than one contiguous block of memory in order to not perform any
 * copies.  A single logical SIDD image which spans multiple NITF image segments
 * is supported; unrelated SIDD images in one NITF are not yet supported.
