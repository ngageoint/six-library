/*!
 *  Unlike in Java, we have chosen to make our InputStream and OutputStream
 *  classes into interfaces, not abstract classes (in the sense that we
 *  did not allow the mark object).  This allowed us to create a third
 *  interface which we use for sockets, among other things: the 
 *  BidirectionalStream and ByteStream interfaces.  These have a strong
 *  need to behave similarly to their C++/C counterparts.  
 *
 *  As a result, where Java simply adds an offset field to the read() and
 *  write() methods, we felt that it would make more sense to have 
 *  an interface for seeks.  Down the line, this allows us to keep our
 *  sockets simple, but to implement full-fledged file IO seeks.
