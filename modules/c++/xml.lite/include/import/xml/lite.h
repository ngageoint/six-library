 *
 *  The xml.lite is a simple lightweight API for XML programming.
 *  It is based on the PHP, Perl and Python implementations.  The
 *  idea behind it is that it avoids much of the bloat of W3C specifications,
 *  particularly the notorious DOM specifications, leaving the practical
 *  API's and discarding the overly-complex or confusing ones.
 *
 *  Getting started with xml.lite is fairly straight-forward, with the
 *  assistance of the <a href="../GettingStarted.html">quickstart article</a>
