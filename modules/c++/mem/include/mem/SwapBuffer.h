 *  \class SwapBuffer
 *  \brief Buffer for ping/pong processing
 *
 *  This buffer allows for users to both create data internally
 *  by specifying the number of bytes need per buffer, or the user
 *  can pass in externally created buffers. However, it's the user's
 *  responsibility to deallocate any externally created memory.
 *
 *  NOTE: This class was intentionally created without a reset method
 *        because losing track of the state of allocation on the 
 *        current memory could result in segmentation faults. 
 *        Specifically, if a user sends in data pointers, then uses 
 *        a reset method, they could be tempted to delete the pointers
 *        returned from the get* methods, which would segfault when 
 *        the ScopedAlignedArrays go out of scope.
