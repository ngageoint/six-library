 *  \class ConvexHull
 *  \brief Uses the Graham scan algorithm to calculate the convex hull of
 *         a batch of points
 *
 *  This is a class rather than a function to simplify the implementation
 *
 *  Due to the implementation, T must be a signed type that can be used to
 *  add, subtract, and multiply without worrying about overflow or
 *  wrapping around.
 *  For example, sys::SSize_T or double.
 *  The class will not compile when instantiated with an unsigned type.
 *
 *  This implementation is based heavily on Mark Nelson's explanation and
 *  sample code at: http://marknelson.us/2007/08/22/convex.
 *  The article also appeared in a Dr. Dobb's article on 9/13/2007:
 *  http://www.ddj.com/architect/201806315.
