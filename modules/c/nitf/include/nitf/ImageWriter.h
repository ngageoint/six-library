 * \brief nitf_ImageWriter_setWriteCaching - Enable/disable cached writes
 *
 * nitf_ImageWriter_setWriteCaching enables/disables cached writes. Enabling
 * cached writes causes the system to accumulate full blocks of data prior to
 * writing. This is more efficent in terms of writing but requires more memory.
 *
 * For blocking modes, R, P, and B blocking modes, one block sized buffer is
 * required for each block column (number of blocks/row). For S mode one
 * block is required for each band for each block column, however for the
 * same iamge dimensions, pixel size and number of bands it amount to the
 * same storage since the blocks of the S mode image are smaller (each
 * contains only one band of data)
 *
 * \return Returns the current enable/disable state

 * \brief nitf_ImageWriter_setDirectBlockWrite - Enable/disable direct block writing
 *
 * nitf_ImageWriter_setDirectBlockWrite enables/disables direct block writing.
 * If this is set to 1 and the number of image bands is 1, then each block of data
 * will be written directly to the NITF and bypass any manipulation or re-organization.
 * If you know for certain that your band sources will give you the data formatted
 * precisely as required for whatever you're writing out, then enable this for better
 * write performance.  This is most useful in conjunction with the DirectBlockSource
 * band source for file copies.
 *
 * This operation will fail if trying to enable direct block writing for multiband
 * images.
