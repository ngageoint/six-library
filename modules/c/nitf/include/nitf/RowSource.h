  \file RowSource - Band source implementation for data produced in rows

  The RowSource object is derived from the DataSource object and is used for
  algorithms that generate data in rows. The RowSource object provides a
  wrapper to integrate a row oriented algorithm into the Writer source model.

  An example is the generation of the magnitude of a complex function. If the
  intended input image is very large and memory constraints prevent reading
  the entire image into memory, this simple algorithm could be implemented by
  reading the input in groups of full rows (strips), transforming each strip
  and then writing the rows to the output file.

  The algorithm must be organized into an object that allows generation of
  individual rows. In the example, the algorthm object would have to have a
  a setup function that initializes whatever state is required to begin
  processing rows. A "nextRow" method is required as well as a clean-up
  function. The "nextRow" function specifies the band and the algorithm
  object and must be able to provide the row data one band at a time. The
  caller is responsible for the making the set-up and clean-up calls and the
  object must handle input processing. The object may make the following two
  assumptions (only):

       Requests to the object are sequential, no seeks
       Requests to the object are in units of whole rows
       Bands from the same image source are read in parallel
