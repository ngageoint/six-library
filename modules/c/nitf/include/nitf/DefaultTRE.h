 *  \brief The default TRE handler is what gets run if no handler
 *  is defined
 *
 *  When the reader finds a TRE, it first checks the plug-in registry
 *  to see if it has a known plug-in handler.  If not, this function
 *  is called instead.  The default handler behavior is simply to
 *  store the raw data in a string in the hash table.
 *
 *  \param io The io handle situated at the beginning of the TRE
 *  \param tre The tre to use
 *  \param error The structure to populate if an error occurs
 *  \return The status
