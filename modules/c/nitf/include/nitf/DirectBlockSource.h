  \file DirectBlockSource - Band source implementation for data read directly

  The DirectBlockSource object is derived from the DataSource object and is used
  in cases when the user wants to directly read blocks from file without
  requiring any re-formatting or re-organization.  One such case would be a file
  copy.  Another would be some sort of block-level data merge where data from
  all sources is formatted the same.

  This allows higher performance reading and writing in such cases where the
  user knows the data is formatted a certain way.
